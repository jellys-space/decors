  <p><u><b>Info</b></u></p>
  <p>Hi, I am Jelly~</p>
    <p>I am the creator of the Jelly's Space Decor website. I am also a Moderator & Reviewer for the Decor Vencord Plugin. Chances are, if you've submitted something to Decor it probably got approved (or denied haha) by me!</p>
    
    <p>I made this page because I am currently living in a homeless shelter and my finances are not very great at all. I also struggle with physical and mental disabilities which is making life all the worst, with a lack of sustainable income or workplace environments.</p>

    <p>Not only that, but my country's government refuses to acknowledge me or support me. No benefits or housing support or income support. My physical disability prevents me from being able to stand or walk for very long, so most jobs aren't applicable. And working from home jobs are scarce.</p>

    <p>As of June 2025, my situation has slightly improved, but it remains challenging. I would greatly appreciate any support you can offer. I’ve dedicated countless hours, days, weeks, and months to providing a free service. Gaining web development skills through this experience has been a significant milestone for me.</p>
    
    <p>As I provide a free service via my Jelly's Space Decor website as well as providing a place for artists to build a public portfolio, I would be extremely appreciative of any and all donations❤️ But rest assured that donating is entirely OPTIONAL.</p>

    <p>Please note that I am <b><u>NOT</u></b> paywalling the site, adding paid features or implementing ads. Donating is entirely optional. The site will remain free and open source as it always has been!</p>
