  <p><u><b>How do I upload my decors to your site?</b></u></p>
  <p>To submit your decors, you will need to contact me on Discord. You can join the <a href="https://discord.gg/dXp2SdxDcP">Decor Server</a> and then ping me in the #decoration-discussion channel.</p>
  <p>Please follow these guidelines as well as <a href="https://i.imgur.com/WHo9g5S.png">Decor's Guidelines</a>:</p>
  <p><b>1.</b> Must be <b>YOUR OWN</b> work. Stolen/unoriginal decorations will be denied.</p>
  <p><b>2.</b> Must have a particular theme/category, rather than several unrelated decors.</p>
  <p><b>3.</b> Must submit a minimum of 6 decors per submission. I'd rather not create a new category and banner just for 1 or 2 decorations. (Negotiations can be made)</p>
  <p><b>4.</b> AI Generated decorations are NOT accepted at this point in time.</p>
  <p><b>5.</b> Must use the <a href="https://i.imgur.com/PdfzGUl.png">template</a> to ensure correct sizing. Please try to avoid the red and blue areas.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><u><b>Failed to fetch?</b></u></p>
  <p>If you get the 'Failed to fetch' error upon authorizing Decor, this is likely due to restrictions on your internet network.</p>
  <p>Try using a VPN and seeing if that allows you to authorize!</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><u><b>Request Takedown</b></u></p>
  <p>If for some reason you would like your decoration removed, or you're an artist claiming something as stolen, please contact me immediately. You can find me in the <a href="https://discord.gg/dXp2SdxDcP">Decor Server</a> on Discord.</p>
  <p>All Decorations submitted to me do go through background checks, but people can obviously lie and fake things. It is not the intention of this website to host unauthorized material.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><u><b>Donators:</b></u></p>
  <p><b>callievd:</b> Thank you SO MUCH for your kind and generous donation, and for the amazing decors you made for the site and for other people. You are a star!</p>
